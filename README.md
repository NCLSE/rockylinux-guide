## Preamble

I wrote this because maybe this book is useful for many people, especially those who use Rocky Linux / RHEL based. Rocky Linux itself was created by the founder of CentOS who was disappointed because CentOS was made upstream from RHEL. So he made a new linux distro which is totally based on RHEL not upstream from RHEL
